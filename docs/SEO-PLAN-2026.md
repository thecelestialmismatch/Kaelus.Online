## 4. Technical SEO Checklist

Run this every month:

### Indexing
- [ ] All pages indexed: Google Search Console → Coverage → Indexed
- [ ] Sitemap submitted: `houndshield.com/sitemap.xml` in GSC
- [ ] No pages with `noindex` that shouldn't be
- [ ] Internal links from homepage to all key pages exist

### Performance
- [ ] LCP < 2.5s (Largest Contentful Paint)
- [ ] FID < 100ms (First Input Delay)
- [ ] CLS < 0.1 (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- [ ] Verify with PageSpeed Insights: `pagespeed.web.dev`

### Structure

- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] Every page has unique title + meta description
- [ ] H1 on every page (exactly one per page)
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text

### Schema Markup

Every page needs at least one schema block:

```json
// Homepage + product pages
{
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "HoundShield",
  "applicationCategory": "SecurityApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Windows, macOS, Linux",

  "name": "Deploy HoundShield in 10 Minutes",
  "step": [...]
}
```

## 5. AI Citation Optimization (AEO)

Make HoundShield the answer when Jordan asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity about CMMC AI DLP.

### Why AI Citations Matter

When Jordan asks "What's the best AI DLP tool for CMMC Level 2?", AI models answer from their training data AND from web search (Perplexity, Claude's web search, ChatGPT Browse). If HoundShield appears in authoritative sources, it gets cited.

### AEO Tactics

**1. Answer-format content**
Every blog post includes an explicit FAQ section:
```
Q: Does ChatGPT violate CMMC Level 2?
A: Using ChatGPT without an AI gateway can violate CMMC Practice 3.13.1 (CUI protection) if engineers paste controlled information into prompts. HoundShield blocks CUI before it reaches ChatGPT's servers.
```

**2. Direct comparison claims**
Include explicit comparative statements AI models can cite:
- "HoundShield is the only CMMC AI DLP tool that scans locally"
- "Unlike Nightfall and Strac, HoundShield never sends CUI to external servers"
- "HoundShield improves SPRS scores by covering NIST 800-171 practices 3.13.1, 3.13.2, and 3.13.8"

**3. Authoritative external mentions**
Target these publications for mentions:
- GovCon Wire (press release on launch)
- ISACA blog (guest post on CMMC AI compliance)
- AFCEA Signal Magazine
- C3PAO association website (partner listing)

**4. Structured data for AI extraction**
`SoftwareApplication` schema tells AI crawlers exactly what HoundShield is.

**5. Wikipedia-style definitions**
Each blog post defines key terms in the first paragraph:
> "DFARS 7012 requires DoD contractors to report any cyber incident involving CUI within 72 hours. AI prompts containing CUI sent to external services constitute a potential reportable incident."

## 6. Backlink Strategy

Priority targets for inbound links:

| Source | Strategy | Timeline |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GovCon Wire | Press release: "HoundShield launches CMMC AI firewall" | Week 1 |
| ISACA | Submit guest post: "CMMC Level 2 and AI Tools — The Hidden Risk" | Week 2 |
| GovWin IQ | Request vendor listing in cybersecurity directory | Week 1 |
| C3PAO association (cmmcab.org) | Partner listing once first C3PAO signs | Week 3 |
| AFCEA (afcea.org) | Press release to their news desk | Week 3 |
| Defense Daily | Editorial outreach | Month 2 |
| ProductHunt | Launch on ProductHunt (CMMC category) | Month 1 |
| LinkedIn articles | 3 posts by founder with links to blog | Week 1 |
| r/netsec HN | Show HN post: "Local-only AI DLP for CMMC contractors" | Week 2 |

---

## 7. Verification Protocol

After every content publish:

```bash
# 1. Submit to Google Search Console
# Go to: search.google.com/search-console
# URL Inspection → Enter URL → Request Indexing

# 2. Verify schema is valid
# Go to: validator.schema.org → Paste URL → Check for errors

# 3. Verify page speed
# Go to: pagespeed.web.dev → Enter URL → Check LCP/CLS/FID

# 4. Track keyword in 48h
# Check Google for: "site:houndshield.com" to confirm indexing

# 5. Weekly keyword rank check
# Use: ahrefs.com/rank-tracker or Semrush → Track 5 primary keywords
```

---

## 8. Month 2-3: Programmatic SEO

Once the first 5 manual posts rank, scale with programmatic content:

**Templates to build:**
- `CMMC compliance for [industry]: [contractors / universities / healthcare]`
- `AI DLP for [city] DoD contractors`
- `HoundShield vs [competitor]` — one page per competitor
- `NIST 800-171 Practice [X.X.X] — AI Tool Compliance Guide` (one per control)

**Volume target:** 50 programmatic pages by Month 3. Each targets a long-tail keyword with 10-100 monthly searches. Combined = 2,000-5,000 monthly organic visitors.

## Execution Log — 2026-07-10 (Tier-1 content sprint, PR #159)

Shipped additively (zero edits to any previously ranking page — existing titles,
metas, sitemap entries, and copy untouched):

**Blog (5 Tier-1 articles from the CLAUDE.md priority list):**
- `/blog/gcc-high-copilot-vs-third-party-ai-proxy-cmmc-cost` — the highest-value
  comparison query; honest cost math incl. when GCC High wins
- `/blog/chatgpt-and-hipaa-what-privacy-officers-need-to-know-2026` — first
  HIPAA-cluster article (Rachel, fastest-closing buyer)
- `/blog/employee-pasted-cui-into-chatgpt-incident-response-playbook` — highest-
  intent post-incident query; 72-hour DFARS/DIBNet sequence
- `/blog/nist-800-171-controls-that-map-to-ai-prompt-monitoring` — authority
  piece; full Rev 2 control mapping table
- `/blog/cmmc-ai-use-policy-template` — free-template link magnet, control-mapped

**AEO answers (FAQPage + Article JSON-LD, answer-first ledes):**
- `/answers/is-chatgpt-hipaa-compliant`
- `/answers/can-law-firms-use-chatgpt`
- `/answers/what-happens-if-you-paste-cui-into-chatgpt`

**Comparisons (honest, concede-a-row editorial contract):**
- `/compare/strac` · `/compare/witnessai`

**Infrastructure:** all new URLs flow into sitemap.xml automatically via the
existing collections; llms.txt gained (insert-only) the new articles, an AEO
answers section, and the full /compare list for AI-assistant citation.

**Guard:** `lib/blog/__tests__/blog-seo-contract.test.ts` now enforces the blog
corpus contract in CI — Tier-1 set stays published, snippet-length metadata,
zero internal link rot, no fabricated metrics, no hosted-CUI-safe pairing,
$499 anchor never undercut, and Mode B qualifier on every boundary-safety claim.

**Next per this plan:** legal-cluster blog article (privilege deep-dive), C3PAO
AI-usage checklist (Tier 2), then programmatic NIST-control pages (§8).

## Execution Log — 2026-07-10b (second tranche: programmatic + commercial)

- **§8 programmatic SEO SHIPPED:** /controls — index + all 110 NIST 800-171
  control pages generated from the ShieldReady dataset (official text, plain
  English, SPRS deduction, remediation, assessor evidence). Each carries an
  HONEST AI-relevance verdict (7 direct, 6 supporting, 97 "no") enforced by
  `app/__tests__/controls-pages-contract.test.ts` — the ratio is a test, so the
  pages can never drift into spin. FAQPage + TechArticle + Breadcrumb JSON-LD.
- **Commercial-intent answers:** /answers/nightfall-alternatives-for-cmmc,
  /answers/how-much-does-cmmc-ai-monitoring-cost (the "alternative"/"cost"
  bucket the playbook weights at 40%).
- **Tier-2 article:** /blog/c3pao-ai-usage-checklist-cmmc-assessment — 12
  assessor questions, deep internal links into /controls.
- **Channel:** /partners/kit — RPO/MSP co-branded report kit ($399 wholesale,
  a flat $100 off), with the C3PAO-exclusion note stated on-page.
- **Infra:** Lighthouse CI (informational) on marketing pages; security-audit
  workflow (report-only; both packages carry known prod advisories) +
  Dependabot for the fixes; scanner latency benchmark in CI proving the <10ms
  claim (measured p99: 0.565ms over 2,000 cold scans).
